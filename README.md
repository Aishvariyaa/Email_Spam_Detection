# 📧 **SpamX – Intelligent Spam Email Classifier (Binary Classification)**

## 🔍 Overview

**SpamX** is a Machine Learning-based text classification system that detects whether a message is **Spam (1)** or **Not Spam (0)**.
It uses **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** techniques with **TF-IDF vectorization** and multiple machine learning models such as **Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM** to ensure accurate classification.

## 🚀 Features

✔️ Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, tokenization)
✔️ TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
✔️ Multiple ML models trained & evaluated
✔️ Achieved **100% accuracy** on the given dataset
✔️ Extendable to real-world datasets for production use

## 📊 Results

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Naïve Bayes            | 100%     | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     |
| Logistic Regression    | 100%     | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     |
| Support Vector Machine | 100%     | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     |

⚠️ **Note:** Perfect accuracy suggests the dataset may be too clean or overfitting. Testing with larger real-world datasets is recommended.
